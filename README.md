# Real-time-Sign-Language-Recognition

## Breaking Barriers with OpenCV and CNNs for Seamless American Sign Language Interpretation

Embark on a transformative journey into the realm of Sign Language Recognition, where cutting-edge technology meets inclusivity. In this project, we intricately explore the fusion of OpenCV and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop a real-time system for interpreting American Sign Language (ASL) gestures. Our focus extends beyond mere recognition; we aim to break down communication barriers for individuals with hearing disabilities. Immerse yourself in the project as we decode the intricacies of ASL, ensuring a seamless and accurate interpretation through the convergence of computer vision and deep learning.
